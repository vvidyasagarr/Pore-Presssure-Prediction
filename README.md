# Pore-Presssure-Prediction




The pressure of groundwater contained within a soil or rock, in spaces between particles, 
is referred to as "pore water pressure.
" Piezometers are used to measure the pore water pressures that exist below the phreatic level of the groundwater.
In general, it can be assumed that the vertical pore water pressure distribution in aquifers is close to hydrostatic. 
Many diverse operations that are carried out in relation to geophysics, drilling, mining, etc., result in the observation of pore pressure. 
Pore pressure estimation using machine learning may be critically important in the future.


An example of an Indian peri-cratonic passive margin basin is the Krishna Godavari Basin. It has an area of more than
50,000 square kilometres close to the coast of Andhra Pradesh in the Krishna and Godavari river basins. 
India has access to significant fuel reserves in the KG Basin, including both conventional and unconventional resources. 
The Krishna Godavari basin's natural gas production is a crucial component of India's plans to increase domestic production and 
decrease its reliance on imports. 
The KG Basin produces 9.8 million metric standard cubic metres of natural gas per day and 19,190 barrels of crude oil per day.


In this study, we'll aim to make predictions about the porous pressure in India's KG Basin.
We have a set of data that includes a number of factors that are connected to pore pressure and 
will be utilised as independent variables to make predictions. 
We'll employ many ML models and compare them in an effort to determine which one will work best when deployed in the real world.
We'll also look at certain trends in the KG Basin and how they're affecting things.
